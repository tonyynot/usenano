A directory of merchants that accept Nano cryptocurrency payments.

## Purpose

The goal of usenano.org is to build a website ([usenano.org](https://usenano.org)) with a comprehensive list of merchants that accept Nano, as well as their website and contact information.

Our aim is to promote global adoption of Nano, a peer to peer feeless and instant digital currency.

## Running Locally

usenano.org is built upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the [github-pages](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) gem.
In order to run the site locally, it is necessary to install bundler, install all dependencies, and then use Jekyll to serve
the site. If the `gem` command is not available to you, it is necessary to install Ruby with RubyGems.
Once Ruby and RubyGems are installed and available from the command line, usenano.org can be setup using the following commands.

```
gem install bundler
cd ~/usenano
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The usenano website should then be accessible from `http://localhost:4000`.

## Donate
All donations are greatly appreciated and will go towards advancing the usenano.org project through global promotion of the directory, networking merchants and customers across the world.
